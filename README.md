## Features of Deployment
Initial Setup and Environment:
* Clears the terminal and sets the default text editor to nano.
* Defines variables for color outputs, versioning information, and host data collection (network interface, IP address, etc.).

Root/Sudo Check:
* Verifies if the script is being executed with root or sudo privileges. If not, it exits with an error message, as the script requires administrative privileges to run.

Password Generation:
* Generates random passwords for various services (MySQL root, phpMyAdmin user, etc.) using a random string generator function.

System Data Collection:
* Detects the operating system (either RedHat/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu) and collects key host information such as distribution version, hostname, and IP address. If the OS is unsupported, the script exits.

Software Removal:
* Ubuntu Pro is detached and purged from the host.
* Cloud-init is deleted and purged from the host.
 
Software Installation:
* Apache Web Server: Installs Apache and sets appropriate permissions for the /var/www/html directory.
* MySQL: Installs MySQL server, creates a secure root user, and sets up phpMyAdmin with a user and password.
* phpMyAdmin: Automatically configures phpMyAdmin for database management.
* Dependencies: Installs various packages, including PHP, required PHP modules, and other utilities like net-tools, nmap, perl, and python.

Webmin Setup:
* Installs Webmin, a web-based system configuration tool, enabling easier server management.

VSFTPD (FTP Server):
* Installs and configures VSFTPD for FTP access, including SSL for secure FTP (FTPS).

SSL Certificates:
* Generates self-signed SSL certificates for both VSFTPD and Apache to secure web and FTP services.

Firewall Configuration:
* Configures ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) to allow necessary ports for Apache, HTTPS, FTP, MySQL, Webmin, and a dynamically generated SSH port (randomly selected to improve security).

## Key Advantages:
* **Fully Automated**: Once executed, the script handles everything from software installation to firewall configuration, reducing the need for manual intervention.
* **Security Enhancements**: The script automatically sets up SSL certificates for both Apache and FTP services and changes the default SSH port to a random high number, enhancing system security.
* **Convenient Access**: After installation, tools like Webmin and phpMyAdmin provide a GUI-based method to manage the server and databases, respectively.

## Usage:
* The script is suitable for users who want to deploy a web server with minimal effort on an Ubuntu system. It simplifies the process by integrating several services into one automated setup.

## Install Commands
Install Git and clone the "lamp" package
```
sudo apt-get -y install wget git
