## Disclaimer
This LAMP Script in this repository are created for educational purposes, and this is going to be deployed in a professional environment proper planning and scoping should be completed.

## Purpose
The script is modular built with many differnt interating files sourced in to complete a task.  This automates the installation, configuration, and setup of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack. It includes additional features like installing phpMyAdmin, Webmin, and VSFTPD for managing web servers and FTP services with SSL support.<br /><br />
As this is a webserver, best practice is to use a host that has or can be configured to use a static IP address.  However, there is a provision in the script that detect if the IP address is not Static and will use a dynamic IP address.  This carries risk, as your IP address could change at reboot or when the TTL allocation for the dynamic IP address expires.<br /><br />
Program designed, developed, and tested while at university studying Computer Science for module "Managing a Web Server (maws_h16s35)"<br />

## Features of Deployment
Initial Setup and Environment:
* Clears the terminal and sets the default text editor to nano.
* Defines variables for color outputs, versioning information, and host data collection (network interface, IP address, etc.).

Root/Sudo Check:
* Verifies if the script is being executed with root or sudo privileges. If not, it exits with an error message, as the script requires administrative privileges to run.

Password Generation:
* Generates random passwords for various services (MySQL root, phpMyAdmin user, etc.) using a random string generator function. 
* This incorporates all variations of **A-Z a-z 0-9 !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?** and for additial security, during setup the passwords are generated at a length of 21 long, injected into the application and deleted form runtime memory.

System Data Collection:
* Detects the operating system (either RedHat/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu) and collects key host information such as distribution version, hostname, and IP address. If the OS is unsupported, the script exits.

IP Address Check (Static)
* Detects if the host has been configured with a static IP address.  If not this will check if NMCLI is installed and prompt to installed by user choice.
* Either (y/n) will continue with configuration of static IP address setup using NMCLI or Default build-in.  NMCLI is preferred but will work either way. 

Software Removal:
* Ubuntu Pro is detached and purged from the host.
* Cloud-init is deleted and purged from the host.
 
Software Installation:
* Apache Web Server: Installs Apache and sets appropriate permissions for the /var/www/html directory.
* MySQL: Installs MySQL server, creates a secure root user, and sets up phpMyAdmin with a user and password.
* phpMyAdmin: Automatically configures phpMyAdmin for database management.
* Dependencies: Installs various packages, including PHP, required PHP modules, and other utilities like net-tools, nmap, perl, and python.

Webmin Setup:
* Installs Webmin, a web-based system configuration tool, enabling easier server management.

VSFTPD (FTP Server):
* Installs and configures VSFTPD for FTP access, including SSL for secure FTP (FTPS).

SSL Certificates:
* Generates self-signed SSL certificates for both VSFTPD and Apache to secure web and FTP services.

Firewall Configuration:
* Configures ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall) to allow necessary ports for Apache, HTTPS, FTP, MySQL, Webmin, and a dynamically generated SSH port (randomly selected to improve security).

User Interation
* Interaction is minimal with this deployment.  Depending on what the scritps finds during deplyment there will only be yes or no options.
* There is the possibility you may be asked to enter an IP Address that is static.  Further data will be required, such as Gateway, DNS addresses and CIDR Notation of network.
* The last interaction will be the vHost demplotment which is mentioned below.

vHosts Deployment
* There is an option to deploy vHosts and have them auto configured to use HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443).
* The option to pick how many vHosts you want to deploy.  Each with their own directory and configured in "apache2/sites-available" at the same time.
* A further option to deploy a CMS platform on each vHost, with a selection of Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, ModX, and Grav.

## Key Advantages:
* **Fully Automated**: Once executed, the script handles everything from software installation to firewall configuration, reducing the need for manual intervention.
* **vHost Input**: Fully deployed vHosts into "apache2/sites-available" configured with ports 80 and 443.
* **Security Enhancements**: The script automatically sets up SSL certificates for both Apache and FTP services and changes the default SSH port to a random high number, enhancing system security.
* **Convenient Access**: After installation, tools like Webmin and phpMyAdmin provide a GUI-based method to manage the server and databases, respectively.
* **Efficient Deployment**: The script is suitable for users who want to deploy a web server with minimal effort on an Ubuntu system. It simplifies the process by integrating several services into one automated setup.

## Install Commands
Install Git and clone the "lamp" package
```
sudo apt-get -y install wget git
git clone https://github.com/Valikahn/lamp.git
```

## Execute Script
Change directory -->  Make shell file executable -->  sudo run the script<br />
Thats it - there is only one interaction required (y/n)
```
cd lamp
chmod +x lamp.linux.deb_rpm.sh
sudo ./lamp.linux.deb_rpm.sh
```

## Directory Structure
The structure of downloadable files are on a modular base to facilitate a reuse of variables and functions to keep system resources low during deployment.<br />
This structure may change without notice as this code is developed and Operating System versions change and features are added.
