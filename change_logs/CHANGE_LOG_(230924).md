NEW ADDITIONS

###--------------------  FILE STRUCTURE CHANGE  --------------------###<br />
Added "include" directure with .sh files including functions and variables for the main script to inject when needed.
This saving on resources on the host; not loading one file into memory and only accessing the data when needed.

###--------------------  IONCUBE LOADER  --------------------###<br />
Encoding support for PHP 8.2, 8.1, 7.4 and many others.
Unique runtime compatibility allowing 8.2 encoded files to run on up to PHP 8.3 without re-encoding.

###--------------------  STATIC IP ADDRESS  --------------------###<br />
Static IP address check as this is recommended to build and configure a WebServer.
This will check using default method if NMCLI is not installed.
This will prompt if NMCLI is not installed if you would like to install and continue.
